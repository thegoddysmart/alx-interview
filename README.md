# ALX Interview

## Understand Key Concepts
Review object-oriented programming principles (like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism) and dynamic programming techniques (like memoization and tabulation). Make sure you can explain and apply these concepts.

## Practice Coding Problems
Work on problems that involve OOP and dynamic programming. Platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal are great for this.

## Review Common Patterns
For OOP, understand common design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Strategy. For dynamic programming, practice problems involving knapsack, longest common subsequence, and coin change.

## Communicate Clearly
During the mock interview, practice explaining your thought process clearly and concisely. Think aloud as you solve problems to demonstrate your problem-solving approach.

## Time Management
Practice solving problems within a set time limit to get used to the pressure of real interviews.

## Seek Feedback
After the mock interview, review the feedback you receive to identify areas for improvement.
